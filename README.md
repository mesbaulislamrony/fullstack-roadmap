# Full Stack Developer Roadmap

## Getting started

Full stack development involves both the front-end and back-end of a website or web application. A full-stack developer has a comprehensive understanding of all layers of web development, including the front-end (client-side), back-end (server-side), and database management.

Here we are discussed some topics, what things one should learn and know to be considered as a full stack developer. Hope this article will help us a lot to move forwar.

## Operating System
- [Basic Networking Concepts]()
- [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) - Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system.

## Basic Frontend Knowledge

As a backend developer, you may not need to have proficient knowledge of the frontend stack but you should at least have some basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp/) - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
- [Less](https://lesscss.org/) - Less was originally inspired by Sass, with a leaner feature set and a syntax closely matching CSS, which Sass did not have at the time. (Sass was later inspired by Less to create SCSS, its own CSS-like syntax.)

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap is a powerful, feature-packed frontend toolkit. Build anything—from prototype to production—in minutes.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

## Languages
- [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp/) - C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) - A popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development..

- [MariaDB]() - MariaDB server is a community developed fork of MySQL server.
- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/) - Oracle Database Server or sometimes called Oracle RDBMS or even simply Oracle is a world leading relational database management system produced by Oracle Corporation.

## APIs
- [REST API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) - A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.
- [JSON APIs](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp/) - JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is an encoding scheme that is designed to eliminate the need for an ad-hoc code for each application to communicate with servers that communicate in a defined way.
- [SOAP](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_soap.asp/) - Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a message protocol for exchanging information between systems and applications.

## Tools

- [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) - A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.
